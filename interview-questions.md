# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software framework that allows developers to store, access and edit code. GitHub is an online platfrom that uses Git. 

Researched answer: Git is a version control software that is free, accessible, and not specific to any language or operating system. It was created to track changes in code. GitHub is an online pplatfrom using Git that allows developers to share and store code. Git exists locally, while GitHub is accessed remotely. 

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index in the location within an array, denoted by bracket notation. The value is the primitive data type that is stored at that location within the array. 

Researched answer: An array is a collection of things called elements. Each element consists of content that is a primitive data type recognized by JavaScript. This is knows as the value. Each element also has a location within the array, known as the index. Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element's index is 0, and the index increases by 1 with each additional element. 

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:
Similarities: 
-can be used to assign a variable
-recognized data types in JavaScript
-can be manipulated by select built-in methods

Differences:
-strings are a primitive data type, arrays are a data type that holds other data types
-strings wrapped in "", arrays wrapped in []

Researched answer: A string is a collection of characters, but consists of a single data type. Arrays store a collection of data, and can consist of different data types as long as they are recognized by JavaScript. Strings are wrapped in ""; arrays are wrapped in []. 

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: 
1) Abstraction: to hide away the implementation details of a function, can't see what it is doing at each step
2) Encapsulation: removing access to parts of your code; only leaving accessible what is absolutely necessary
3) Inheritance: allows one object to have the same properties and methods as the parent object it is related to
4) Polymorphism: when using inheritance - two data types that share an inheritance chain can be used interchangably with customizations. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: a built-in method that takes a function as an argument, and iterates that function on each element of an array. 

2. Jest: a JavaScript testing framework made up of a collection of pieces of code functionality called dependencies. 

3. Objects: a data type that connects data with a behavior
